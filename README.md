# SpotifyTracker
Tracks the songs you listen to while Spotify is active, and plots the amount of time spent listening to each song in readable graphs. 

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) app because I wanted to learn how make one and since it MERN apps are easy to set up. 
The entire proeject is under this repository and the frontend, backend, etc. code is distributed into their own directories within this main directory.
